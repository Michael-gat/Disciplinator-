# Disciplinator-
A script to restrict myself to certain activities at certain times of the day (I should build one for my phone btw) 

I mean I could get someone to do it for me but what's the point of learning?????

This is how it will work
It will check my windows every 1 minute 
Compare with the allowed apps for the current time 
Send a desktop notification if I am off task(I will probably want to leave personalised notifications here)

What do I need for this?

Python(ofc)
some libraries
Clear logic 
Maybe I could expand it afterwards into an app that people can use but otherwise...

I need to define my schedule is all


Could I add something that predicts my behaviour even if I fall off? I'm toying with the idea
